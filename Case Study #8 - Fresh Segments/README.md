## Introduction
Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.

## Question and Solution
### A. Data Exploration and Cleansing

#### 1. Update the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table by modifying the `month_year` column to be a date data type with the start of the month
```sql
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ALTER COLUMN month_year TYPE DATE
USING TO_DATE(month_year, 'MM-YYYY');
```
month_year column after altering the datatype

| month_year |
|------------|
| 2019-08-01 |
| 2019-07-01 |
| 2019-06-01 |
| 2019-05-01 |
| 2019-04-01 |
| 2019-03-01 |
| 2019-02-01 |
| 2019-01-01 |
| 2018-12-01 |
| 2018-11-01 |
| 2018-10-01 |
| 2018-09-01 |
| 2018-08-01 |
| 2018-07-01 |

#### 2. What is count of records in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` for each `month_year` value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
```sql
SELECT
    month_year,
    count(*) AS record_count
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST;
```
| month_year | record_count |
|------------|--------------|
| NULL       | 1194         |
| 2018-07-01 | 729          |
| 2018-08-01 | 767          |
| 2018-09-01 | 780          |
| 2018-10-01 | 857          |
| 2018-11-01 | 928          |
| 2018-12-01 | 995          |
| 2019-01-01 | 973          |
| 2019-02-01 | 1121         |
| 2019-03-01 | 1136         |
| 2019-04-01 | 1099         |
| 2019-05-01 | 857          |
| 2019-06-01 | 824          |
| 2019-07-01 | 864          |
| 2019-08-01 | 1149         |

#### 3. What do you think we should do with these null values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`

We should remove them as they are not valid records and will not be useful for our analysis.

```sql
DELETE FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE month_year IS NULL;
```

#### 4. How many `interest_id` values exist in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table but not in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? What about the other way around?
```sql
SELECT interest_id::integer AS interest_id_not_in_metrics
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics me
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT id
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map ma
```
All the interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table also exist in the fresh_segments.interest_map

#### 5. Summarise the `id` values in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` by its total record count in this table

#### 6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where `interest_id = 21246` in your joined output and include all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` and all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_map` except from the id column.
```sql
SELECT
    me.*,
    ma.interest_name,
    ma.interest_summary,
    ma.created_at,
    ma.last_modified
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics me
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma ON me.interest_id = ma.id
WHERE me.interest_id = 21246;
```
| _month | _year | month_year | interest_id | composition | index_value | ranking | percentile_ranking | interest_name                    | interest_summary                                      | created_at          | last_modified       |

#### 7. Are there any records in your joined table where the `month_year` value is before the `created_at` value from the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? Do you think these values are valid and why?
```sql
with cte as (
SELECT
    me.*,
    ma.interest_name,
    ma.interest_summary,
    ma.created_at,
    ma.last_modified
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics me
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma ON me.interest_id = ma.id
WHERE me.interest_id = 21246
)
SELECT * 
FROM cte
WHERE month_year < created_at;
```
The reulst show no value -> There is no month_year before created_at

If the month_year values exists before created_at then they're not valid 
=> The record in the interest_metrics represents the performance of a specific interest_id based on the client‚Äôs customer base interest measured through clicks and interactions -> You can't have user interest or engagement metrics before the interest was even defined/created.
