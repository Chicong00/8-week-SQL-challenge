## 1. Data Cleaning
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS data_mart.clean_weekly_sales;
--create a new table to store the cleaned data
CREATE TABLE data_mart.clean_weekly_sales AS (
SELECT
  TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY') AS week_date, -- convert week_date to date format
  DATE_PART('week', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS week_number, -- add week_number column
  DATE_PART('month', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS month_number, -- add month_number column
  DATE_PART('year', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS calendar_year, -- add year_calendar column
  region, 
  platform, 
  segment,
  CASE 
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) in ('3','4') THEN 'Retirees'
    ELSE 'unknown' END AS age_band, -- add age_band column
  CASE 
    WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'C' THEN 'Couples'
    WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'F' THEN 'Families'
    ELSE 'unknown' END AS demographic, -- add demographic column
  transactions,
  ROUND((sales/transactions),2) AS avg_transaction, -- add avg_transaction column
  sales
FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
);

select * from data_mart.clean_weekly_sales limit 10;
```

## 2. Data Exploration

### 1. What day of the week is used for each `week_date` value?

### 2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

### 3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

### 4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?

### 5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform

### 6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

### 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

### 8. Which `age_band` and `demographic` values contribute the most to Retail sales?

### 9. Can we use the `avg_transaction` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
