## Question and Solution
[SQL syntax](https://github.com/Chicong00/8-week-SQL-challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%236%20-%20Clique%20Bait/Clique_Bait.sql)

### A. Digital Analysis
#### 1. How many users are there?
```sql
select count(distinct user_id) total_users
from clique_bait.users;
```
|total_users|
|---|
|500|

#### 2.How many cookies does each user have on average?
```sql
select 
	round(COUNT(cookie_id)/count(distinct user_id)::numeric,2) avg_cookies_per_user
from clique_bait.users;
```
|avg_cookies_per_user|
|---|
|3.56|

#### 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
```sql
select
	DATE_PART('month',event_time) as month_number,
	count(distinct visit_id) visit_count
from clique_bait.events e 
group by DATE_PART('month',event_time)
order by 1;
```
| month_number | visit_count |
|--------------|-------------|
| 1            | 876         |
| 2            | 1488        |
| 3            | 916         |
| 4            | 248         |
| 5            | 36          |


#### 4. What is the number of events for each event type?
```sql
select 
	event_name,
	count(*) event_count
from clique_bait.events e 
join clique_bait.event_identifier ei
on e.event_type = ei.event_type
group by event_name
order by event_count desc;
```
| event_name    | event_count |
|---------------|-------------|
| Page View     | 20928       |
| Add to Cart   | 8451        |
| Purchase      | 1777        |
| Ad Impression | 876         |
| Ad Click      | 702         |

#### 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
```sql
select	
	event_name,
	cast(100.0*count(distinct visit_id)/(select count(distinct visit_id) from clique_bait.events) as decimal(5,2)) pct_visit_count
from clique_bait.events e
join clique_bait.event_identifier ei
on e.event_type = ei.event_type
where event_name = 'Purchase'
group by event_name;
```
|event_name	|pct_visit_count|
|---|---|
|Purchase|	49.86|

#### 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
- Count the number of visits with event_name = 'Page View' and page_name = 'Checkout'
- Then filter out the number of visits with event_name = 'purchase' in the first condition 
=> Number of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event

```sql
with checkout_view as 
(
select 
	count(distinct visit_id) visit_count
from clique_bait.events e
left join clique_bait.page_hierarchy p on e.page_id = p.page_id
left join clique_bait.event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
where ei.event_name = 'Page View' and p.page_name = 'Checkout'
)
select 
	cast(100-100.0*count(distinct visit_id)/(select visit_count from checkout_view) as decimal(5,2)) pct_view_checkout_not_purchase
from clique_bait.events e 
join clique_bait.event_identifier ei
on e.event_type = ei.event_type
where event_name = 'Purchase';
```
|pct_view_checkout_not_purchase|
|---|
|15.50|

#### 7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?
```sql
with cte as (
select 
	p.page_name,
	count(visit_id) visit_count,
	rank() over (order by count(visit_id) desc) as ranking
from clique_bait.events e
join clique_bait.page_hierarchy p on e.page_id = p.page_id
join clique_bait.event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
where event_name = 'Page View'
group by page_name
order by visit_count desc
)
SELECT
	page_name,
	visit_count
FROM cte 
WHERE ranking  < 4;
```
Top 3 pages by number of views

| page_name    | visit_count |
|--------------|-------------|
| All Products | 3174        |
| Checkout     | 2103        |
| Home Page    | 1782        |


#### 8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
```sql
SELECT 
  ph.product_category, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds_count
from clique_bait.events AS e
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
WHERE ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ph.product_category
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| product_category | page_views_count | cart_adds_count |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Shellfish        | 6204             | 3792            |

| Luxury           | 3032             | 1870            |


#### 9. What are the top 3 products by purchases?
```sql
with cte as (
select 
	ph.page_name,
	ph.product_category,
	count(*) purchase_count,
	rank() over (order by count(*) desc) ranking
from clique_bait.events e 
join clique_bait.event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
join clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph on e.page_id = ph.page_id
-- Step1 : Products are added to cart 
where event_name = 'Add to Cart'
-- Step 2: Add-to-cart products are purchased
and e.visit_id in 
	(select e.visit_id from clique_bait.events e
	join clique_bait.event_identifier ei on e.event_type = ei.event_type
	where event_name = 'Purchase')
group by ph.page_name, ph.product_category 
order by 3 desc
)
SELECT
	page_name,
	product_category,
	purchase_count
FROM cte 
WHERE ranking  < 4;
```

### B. Product Funnel Analysis

#### Create a new output table which has the following details:
- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?

#### Create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

#### 1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?

#### 2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?

#### 3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?

#### 4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?

#### 5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
