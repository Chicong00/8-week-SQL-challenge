from dbo.customer_nodes
````
|unique_node_count|
|---|
|5|
  
2. What is the number of nodes per region?
````sql
SELECT 
    region_name,
    COUNT( node_id) number_of_nodes
from dbo.customer_nodes n 
join dbo.regions r 
on n.region_id = r.region_id 
group by region_name
order by number_of_nodes desc   
````

|---|---|
|Australia|	770|
|America|	735|
|Africa|	714|
|Asia|	665|
|Europe|	616|

3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
````sql
SELECT 
    region_name,
    COUNT(distinct customer_id) customer_count
from dbo.customer_nodes n 
join dbo.regions r

4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
````sql
WITH node_diff AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, node_id, start_date, end_date,
    end_date - start_date AS diff
  FROM customer_nodes
  WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id, start_date, end_date
  ORDER BY customer_id, node_id
  ),
sum_diff_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, node_id, SUM(diff) AS sum_diff
  FROM node_diff
  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id)

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(sum_diff),2) AS avg_reallocation_days
FROM sum_diff_cte;  
````  
|avg_reallocation_days|
|---|
|24|

	avg(txn_amount) avg_amount
from customer_transactions
where txn_type = 'deposit'
group by customer_id
)
select 
	AVG(trans_count) avg_deposit,
	avg(avg_amount) avg_amount
from deposit_type  
````
|avg_deposit|	avg_amount|
|---|---|
|5|	508  |

	sum(case when txn_type = 'purchase' then 1 end) as txn_purchase,
	sum(case when txn_type = 'withdrawal' then 1 end) as txn_withdrawal
from customer_transactions
group by customer_id, txn_date, txn_type
)
,customer as 
(
select customer_id,
	datepart(month,txn_date) month,
	sum(txn_deposit) deposit_count,
	sum(txn_purchase) purchase_count,
	sum(txn_withdrawal) withdrawal_count
from txn_type
group by customer_id, datepart(month,txn_date)
)
select 
	month, 
	count(customer_id) customer_count
from customer
where deposit_count > 1 and( purchase_count = 1 or withdrawal_count = 1 )
